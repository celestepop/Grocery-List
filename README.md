# Overview

This java program was started as a way to learn a new language as well as learn how to create an app. Up until this project, I only knew the more common object-oriented languages like Python and C++. I have become more familiar with objects throughout the project, as well.

This program was written with the end goal of being a good teammate as I work on creating an Andriod app for keeping track of groceries. Therefore, the theme is similar. This software will allow you create a shopping list that also shows the total expected cost of your groceries. Since Java is an object-oriented language, I used a class to create list of items with their price. This would make it easier to keep the item's name and price together.

Since going to the store to buy groceries is a common task, I thought this would be a good program. Before, I would make a list on my phone and then had to use my calculator separately to get the expected cost with taxes included. Now, I just need to add the items and it will give me the total. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and create the files as well as create the repository. As said before, Java is an object-oriented language, so I took advantage of its ability to create objects through classes. I also used the ArrayList and Scanner libraries to create an array list of Item objects and allow input, respectively.

# Future Work

Things to fix, improve, and/or add in the future:

- Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for better usability
- Create it as a web app to use from my phone
